DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Web    Views folder

This is the folder in which all your views will go.  Every file in here is a cshtml file
which is the template and layout for how to display your content to the user. 

This is where your Html, Razor controls, or Angular will go. 

There will be a cooresponding folder for each controller that you create and then under
that folder you would put any views you need for that controller such as the "Index" action
on the controller. Keep in mind that for these to work automagically you have to have the view
file named exactly the same as the ActionResult on the controller.
