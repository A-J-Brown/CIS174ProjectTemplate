DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Web    Scripts folder

This folder is where you are going to put any and all of your javascript files that you
plan on using for your client side UI code.

I recommend that you use javascript for this even though there are some other options. 

I also recommend that you use ES5 javascript standards.
