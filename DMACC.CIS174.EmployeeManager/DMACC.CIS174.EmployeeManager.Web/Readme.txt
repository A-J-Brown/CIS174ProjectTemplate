DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Web

This project is where you are going to put all your UI work into. This will contain all
the views which are the layout and the controllers which are the actions that can be called
in order to display the views with or without data. This is what the user is going to see
and be how the user interacts with your web application.
