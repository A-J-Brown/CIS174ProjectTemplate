DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Api    Models folder

This is a folder that would be used for any models that are specific to your WebApi. If you
are needing a model for your database entities to be sent back to the consumer you would NOT
create models in this folder and instead would create and use a ViewModel in the ViewModels
folder of the DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Shared project.
