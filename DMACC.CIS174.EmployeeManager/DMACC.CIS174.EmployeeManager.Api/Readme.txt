DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Api

This project is where you are going to put your Web Api code.  Anything that will need
to be able to be hit and consumed by outside users will need to go in here.

If your project is primarily a website there won't be much that will go in here other than
your mandatory external web api.

If you project is a mobile app, desktop app, Angular app, or video game you will have almost all your
code in this project because everything will need to be externally available so that your
application can get to it.
