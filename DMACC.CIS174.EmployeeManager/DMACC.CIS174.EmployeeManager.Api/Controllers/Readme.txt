DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Api    Controllers folder

This is the folder that you will want to put any and all of your WebApi controllers.

In order to create a new controller you will want to right click on the controllers folder 
and select "Add" then select "Controller". Then you will select WebAPI 2 controller - Empty.

The controllers should be lean and clear of any business logic.  Some simple validation 
is generally acceptable to put in the controllers. Otherwise you should rely on Orchestrators
to do all the heavy lifting of the business logic.
