DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Shared     Orchestrators folder

This is the folder where you are going to gather and organize the data that you need to
return to the consuming app (Web Api or Web).  This is where pretty much all your business
logic is going to go with the exception of any reuseable service type code.  This is pretty
much where the guts of your back end logic will reside.
