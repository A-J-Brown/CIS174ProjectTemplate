DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Shared

This folder is where you will put all the interfaces for your Orchestrators.  

Interfaces are contracts for minimum functionality that will be provided to a consumer
of any class that implements the interface.  This is highly useful when doing unit testing
so that you can easily mock the orchestrators.

Every Orchestrator in the Orchestrators folder should have a cooresponding interface in this folder.
