DMACC.CIS174.EmployeeManager.Shared     Enums folder

This folder is where you will put your enums and any static string classes that you might have. 

We will use enums and static string classes any time we are dealing with consistant string values. 
This is done in order to be able to use intellisense to get these values right instead of typing
the string out by hand each time which is prone to typos and hard to debug code. Also there are 
times that the values of these widely used strings will need to change and if you are using 
this one spot for it you will only have to update it once instead of everywhere that it is referenced
and then hope that you got all the spots and didn't break anything.
